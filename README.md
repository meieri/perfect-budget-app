# My Perfect Budget App
This is a project intended to practice my Swift and build my ideal budget app. 

## Features (MVP)
The app is intended to be simple in nature. 
The user will input every expense they incurr, and a weekly budget. 
The app will show (as its main screen) the user's weekly expenses compared to their budget. 
The user will be able to view statistics on their spending monthly and yearly as well as weekly.

## More Features in an Ideal World
In later versions, we will add some options to track income, savings, and recurring expenses, and perform calculations on these data points for the benefit of the user. 
Write a Swift server to listen for a user's bank transactions and Venmo? Look into APIs.
